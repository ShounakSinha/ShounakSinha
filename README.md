- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShounakSinha
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersection of technology, psychology, and creativity. My passions include software development, AI prompt engineering, and building solutions that have a meaningful impact.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced AI concepts, particularly in prompt engineering, and diving deep into the world of creative coding with tools like Midjourney, Langchain, and OpenAI Playground. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects in AI, language learning, and e-commerce, especially those that merge technology with human-centric design.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shounak-sinha-b79379270/), or drop me an email at shounaksinha@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm not just an engineer but also a professional public speaker who can talk about anything from finance to films for hours. Plus, I'm a proud Bengali who finds joy in both Rabindranath Tagore's poetry and the thrill of cricket.
